# `--location-mode`

Instructs curl how to do the custom request method set with --request when
following redirects. The default mode is `all`. curl only follows redirects if
instructed to do so with --location.

## keep

The method string you set with --request is used for all requests even after
redirects. It may cause unintended side-effects when curl does not change
request method according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.

## spec

The method string you set with --request is used in subsequent requests for
the status codes 307 or 308, but may be reset to GET for 301, 302 and 303.

## init

The method string you set with --request is used only in the first outgoing
request but not in any additional requests, independently of what status code
is returned.
